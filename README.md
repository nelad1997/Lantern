## 🧠 Project Summary

Lantern is an AI-augmented thinking and writing system designed to support **deliberate reasoning**, **divergent exploration**, and **user agency**.

Rather than generating text automatically, Lantern functions as a *Thinking Partner*, externalizing reasoning into a visual **Tree-of-Thoughts** structure that allows users to compare, evaluate, and refine alternative reasoning paths.
